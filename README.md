![overview](images/pipeline.png "The benchmark construction pipeline and OJ-style evaluation of SpreadsheetBench.")

SpreadsheetBench is a challenging spreadsheet manipulation benchmark that (1) contains 912 questions exclusively derived from real-world scenarios, (2) includes spreadsheet files with tabular data in various formats, (3) features a more reliable evaluation metric akin to online judge platforms.

## News

[2024/06] ðŸ”¥ We released the sample data of SpreadsheetBench.

## Data Statistics and Comparison

SpreadsheetBench comprising 912 instructions and 2,729 test cases, with an average of three test cases per instruction. The instructions in our benchmark cover a broad spectrum of spreadsheet manipulation types, including find, extract, sum, highlight, remove, modify, count, delete, calculate, and display. The spreadsheet files in our benchmark contain tabular data with various row size, column size, number of table and table formats.

Table 1 compares SpreadsheetBench to other spreadsheet manipulation benchmarks. Our questions are sourced exclusively from real-world data and exhibits a higher average word count per instruction. Our spreadsheet files contain multiple sheets with non-standard relational tables and multiple tables within a single sheet. Real-world questions often involve additional explanations within the spreadsheet, a characteristic not present in previous benchmarks. Furthermore, we employ OJ-style evaluation metrics with three test cases per instruction.

## Dataset Introduction

The sample data are located in ``data/sample_data_200.tar.gz``, containing two hundred data points in JSONL formats.
Each data point includes the following five attributes:
- ``id``: The unique id of the data point.
- ``instruction``: The question about spreadsheet manipulation.
- ``spreadsheet_path``: The folder path that stores the test cases.
- ``instruction_type``: The type of the question (i.e., Cell-Level Manipulation or Sheet-Level Manipulation).
- ``answer_position``: The cell position where the answer needs to be filled in.
